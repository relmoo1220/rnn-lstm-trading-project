# Price Movement Prediction with RNN-LSTM

This project aims to predict financial asset price movements using historical data from Yahoo Finance. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers built on TensorFlow's Keras API. LSTMs are well-suited for time series analysis, making them ideal for predicting stock or asset price movements based on past trends. This model processes sequential stock data to generate predictions, helping to understand future price trends and enhance decision-making for trading or investment purposes.
